				"question": "What data is collected when a link is accessed?",
				"answer": "For each visit, we collect the IP address and user agent. From this information, we determine the browser, device type, and approximate location (including country, region, city, and coordinates). During testing, for legal and security reasons, all requests are recorded with the server's IP address instead of the user&apos;s actual IP. This data is associated with the specific shortened URL and includes the access timestamp."
